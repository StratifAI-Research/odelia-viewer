## Architecture Overview 🔄
The send to AI pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Odelia Viewer**: OHIF based viewer, customized with AI routing and feedback features
2. **Local Orthanc Instance**: Acts as the DICOM server, receiving and managing medical images
3. **Orthanc Router**: The traffic controller that:
   - Receives studies from the local Orthanc
   - Routes them to the appropriate AI model
   - Receives AI inference results
   - Wraps the results in DICOM format
   - Sends everything back to the viewer
4. **AI Model**: The AI model that receives the studies and returns the inference results
