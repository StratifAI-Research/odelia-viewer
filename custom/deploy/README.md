## Quick Start ⚡
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/StratifAI-Research/odelia-deployment
   cd odelia-deployment
   ```

## Architecture Overview 🔄
The send to AI pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Odelia Viewer**: OHIF based viewer, customized with AI routing and feedback features
2. **Local Orthanc Instance**: Acts as the DICOM server, receiving and managing medical images
3. **Orthanc Router**: The traffic controller that:
   - Receives studies from the local Orthanc
   - Routes them to the appropriate AI model
   - Receives AI inference results
   - Wraps the results in DICOM format
   - Sends everything back to the viewer
4. **AI Model**: The AI model that receives the studies and returns the inference results

│   └── app-config.js # Viewer settings
├── logs/            # System logs
└── volumes/         # Storage for medical images
```

## Configuration ⚙️
The viewer comes pre-configured for most use cases. If you need to make changes:
1. The main configuration file is located in `config/app-config.js`
2. Web server settings can be modified in `config/nginx.conf`

## Accessing the Viewer 🌐
- Local deployment: `http://localhost:80`
- Remote deployment: `http://your-server-address:80`
